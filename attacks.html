        <p>1. Real Estate Wealth Network leak</p>
        <p>2024</p>
        <p>Impact: 1.5 billion accounts</p>
        <p>In 2023, the Real Estate Wealth Network experienced a catastrophic data breach that exposed a staggering 1.5 billion records. The compromised data included a wide array of personal and financial information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and investment details. This massive leak has the potential to facilitate phishing attacks, identity theft, and other malicious activities on an unprecedented scale. </p>
        <p>2. Yahoo Hacks</p>
        <p>2013 & 2014</p>
        <p>Impact: 3 billion accounts</p>
        <p>Through two attacks, Yahoo suffered the largest data breaches ever in 2013 and 2014. Although not reported until 2016, it became known as the largest breach in the history of the internet. 
           The breach was executed by four individuals charged in the matter, which was conducted by Russian agents through a hacker-for-hire scheme. Although only 1 of the 4 men ever faced charges, that individual, Mr. Baratov, ended up with hefty fines and a 5-year prison sentence.</p>
        <p>3. PlayStation Network Hacks</p>
        <p>2011</p>
        <p>Impact: 77 million devices</p>
        <p>This attack is likely remembered by security professionals and gamers alike because it marked one of the biggest data breaches ever at the time, with 77 million accounts impacted and  a nearly month-long network shutdown.

            Due to the attack, Sony had to shut down the PlayStation Network for 23 days, which cost the company an estimated $171 million. 
        </p>
        <p>4. Attack on Saudi Aramco</p>
        <p>2012</p>
        <p>Impact: 30,000 computers data wiped</p>
        <p>This famous hack took down the world's largest oil producers and delayed production. The hack took place with a virus known as “Shamoon,” which was “modular and multi-faceted like Stuxnet, but had only one purpose: To find and destroy data.”

            Through the attack, cybercriminals were able to destroy 30,000 computers’ data, which led to a huge amount of information lost and halting operations at the company. While this attack had a limited impact on Aramco’s cash flow, it’s noteworthy because it was a powerful example of cyberattacks impacting the physical world.</p>
        <p>5. First American Financial Corp</p>
        <p>2019</p>
        <p>Impact: 885 Million Files</p>
        <p>In 2019, First American Financial Corp. faced a major data leak due to poor security measures and a flawed website design. This incident, classified as a data leak rather than a breach since no hacking was involved, highlighted how easily sensitive information can be exposed.

            The leak was caused by an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, which allowed access to private information without any verification. Anyone with a link to the documents could view them, and because records were logged in sequential order, users could change the number in the URL to see other customer records.</p>
