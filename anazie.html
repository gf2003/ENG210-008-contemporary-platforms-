        <p><b>Explanation: 

            This graph shows the major industries that run the world today (X-axis). On the Y- axis there are major departments within these industries. These departments have made certain changes in their core functions for better progress. There are three categorizations for the frequency of these changes, from No/minimal change to Significant/fundamental change. 
            
            We can start with travel and logistics; they have made a meaningful change in the sales and marketing departments. The reason for this change could be a collection of data that helps them to analyze what to market to their customers based on the season and time. By carefully analyzing data they can make their consumersâ€™ lives easier by working according to that data. This sounds quite easy to talk about but there is a reason data and analytics is a fresh subject in the computer science community due to the recent popularization of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers also known as GPT. 
            
            Coming to financial services, they had a major change in more departments to facilitate their business functioning in terms of Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, and supply chain management. There are reasons for that because it is a strict industry and without analytics and careful study of their consumers' financial data that is related to the services, they provide they can face legal consequences and damage to their reputation. They can track if any consumer tries to make a misuse of their services. Depending on the type of data they this industry processes is extremely high in volume and to manage that data effectively a lot of advanced software and workforce comes into action. 
            
            Lastly judging from the graph, we can see the industry that made the most changes in the basic materials and energy industry. I am not sure but the volume of data and the velocity of data they recieve is quite high, so it is quite considerable to make these certain changes. </b></p>
